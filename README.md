# **Monte Carlo Simulation for Financial Risk Assessment**

## *A Quantitative Analysis Approach to Estimating Value at Risk (VaR)*

---

## üìå **Overview**

This project presents a comprehensive application of Monte Carlo Simulation methods to estimate Value at Risk (VaR), a key metric for financial risk assessment. It compares advanced numerical techniques for simulating stochastic price dynamics and quantifying potential portfolio losses, incorporating both traditional pseudo-random and quasi-random number generation, along with variance reduction methods, analytical approximations, and convergence diagnostics.

The simulation framework captures asset price behavior using **Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)** and evaluates the impact of these techniques on the precision and efficiency of risk estimations. This model has potential applications in institutional portfolio management, risk control systems, stress testing environments, and quantitative research on financial derivatives pricing and exposure management.

## üìö **Core Methodologies and Mathematical Concepts**

This study integrates several advanced tools and simulation strategies, including:

### **Stochastic Modeling**

- **Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM):** A continuous-time stochastic process representing asset price dynamics under drift and volatility assumptions.
- **Wiener Processes (Brownian Motion):** Modeled through discretized standard normal variables.

### **Random Number Generation**

- **Pseudo-Random Number Generation (PRNG):** Conventional sampling from standard normal distributions.
- **Quasi-Random Number Generation (QRNG):** Sobol sequences (low-discrepancy sequences) with Inverse Transform Sampling for variance reduction and improved convergence.

### **Variance Reduction Techniques**

- **Antithetic Variance Reduction (AVR):** Mirroring sample paths to reduce estimator variance without increasing simulation cost.

### **Value at Risk (VaR) Estimation**

- **Empirical (Quantile-Based) VaR:** Using percentiles of simulated return distributions.
- **Parametric (Normal Approximation) VaR:** Using mean and standard deviation with z-scores.

### **Analytical Approximations**

- **Second-Order Taylor Expansion:** Local approximation of risk functions to estimate the sensitivity of VaR to return changes without repeated full simulations.
- **Finite Difference Derivatives:** Numerical estimation of first and second derivatives for Taylor approximations.

### **Numerical Convergence Analysis**

- **Law of Large Numbers:** Empirical evaluation of estimator precision relative to simulation size.
- **Diminishing Returns Threshold:** Identifying simulation sizes beyond which error reduction becomes marginal.

- QRNG (Sobol) improves convergence rates and simulation stability due to uniform sample space coverage.
- Antithetic Variance Reduction consistently enhances simulation efficiency, especially under PRNG schemes.
- Parametric VaR estimates are generally more conservative than empirical ones due to distributional assumptions.
- Taylor approximations provide fast, local estimates of risk variation but become unstable in extreme tail events.
- Convergence diagnostics demonstrate the practical trade-off between computational cost and estimator precision, guiding real-world simulation scaling decisions.
